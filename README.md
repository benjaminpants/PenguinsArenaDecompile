# Penguin's Arena Decompilation Project

This project is an ambitious effort aimed at the complete decompilation of the 2008 TorqueEngine game, [Penguins Arena: Sedna's World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/11280/Penguins_Arena_Sednas_World/). Our mission is to fully decompile the game's TorqueScript files, with an immediate focus on server-side files, while the client-side scripts are considered a lower priority for the moment. The ultimate goal is to create an enhanced fork that will boost the game's modability and incorporate additional features.

## How to Contribute

We welcome and encourage contributions to this project. You can contribute in the following ways:

- Enhance the existing documentation and comments within the scripts
- Improve the accuracy of a script, particularly if you identify inaccuracies
- Upgrade the decompiler to streamline the decompilation process and reduce manual labor

## How to Use

To use the modified files:

1. Make sure you have the original game installed.
2. Replace the game's original TorqueScript files with the decompiled files from this repository.
3. Start your game as usual. The game engine will automatically compile the modified files into valid .cs.dso files on launch.

Please note that these changes are permanent - the modified scripts will replace the original game files. Therefore, if you wish to revert back to the original game version, it is recommended that you keep a backup of the original files. The game will automatically compile the scripts, overwriting the originals.

Please use the decompiled scripts responsibly and respect the original creators' rights.
